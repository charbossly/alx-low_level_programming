### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future](./1-create_dynamic_lib.sh)
* Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.


### [3. Let's call C functions from Python](./100-operations.so)
* Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python.


### [4. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!](./101-make_me_win.sh)
* I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
